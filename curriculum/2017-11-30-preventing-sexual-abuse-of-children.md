## Talk about it

What fears or beliefs do I have that could stop me from talking openly with children about sexual abuse? 
- can't find age appropriate language
- can't explain power dynamics to kids
- fear of social isolation
- hopelessness of a situation

*I think the goal, however, is to ensure that kiddos aren't mal-conditioned or misprogrammed to view themselves as objects.* 

- Do you feel ashamed when someone touches your back? 
- Did you know that your front groin is called your genitals? 
- Your lower back is your buttocks? 
- You can decide that you don't want to be touched there.

My attitude: curious, questioning, open.

### Testimonies

- The way she said it, I became afraid of hurting my family. I chose to endure.
- The abuser is also my guardian.
	- Children maybe can't create moral distinctions.
	- pay attention to little quirks (biting as a coping mech, etc)
- "Daddy ate my cookie" could be a disclosure---right, it's up to interpretation.
	- semiotic traps
	- use biological/anatomical terminology
	- using "penis" and "vagina" in polite conversation
