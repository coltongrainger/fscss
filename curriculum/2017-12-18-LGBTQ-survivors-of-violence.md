From a webinar with [Marci Taitt-Lamar](https://vawnet.org/).

## LGBTQ language

- use queer language in polite conversation!
- find local resources
	- how do people describe their lives here?
	- san fran vs. oly, East vs. West coast

## Victim/Survivor language

- advocacy model langauge, criminal language
- def: survivor
	- is controlled? subjected to violence?
- person who batters, person who abuses
	- often can make eloquent, contrite statements
	- tend to control and exploit over time
	- few folks abuse on first dates
	- showing up a work

Tactics related to battery: harm, control, exploitation
- "you're a stupid bitch!" (not illegal)
- it's rather hard to criminalize all that a batterer can leverage

- rely on systems of oppression, social inequality
	- leveraged to maintain control

Ex: LGBTQ the targets of homophobia
straight people talking to eachother: "shelter's are full of dykes"

Ex: bankers would like the husband to counter sign
"don't give any money to the lady"
used to maintain control

## Criminal legal system

this moment, this punch, not patterns, but moments
- what *this* action illegal?
- not looking at the continuum

also posits individual equality under the law
- "blinded justice"
- implicit bias? how so?
	- legislation: what's illegal?
	- arrest frequency: who's arrested?
	- charging, trials, sentencing

challenge: we can easily collapse the frames between victim and survivor.
- advocacy frame: survivor/person who abuses
- criminal frame: victim/perpetrator

but also, with drug related assaults, etc, the criminal justice system flips the binaries. How are NGOs responsible?

law enforcement going out to a same sex relationship, 30x more likely to arrest the couple. we can't recognize who "perpetrated", so both folks are arrested.

when folks are surviving:
survived and punished, marissa alexander

what are the parameters for self defense in my juristiction?
- we don't know

yet, some folks *do* use violence outside of self defense.
does this disqualify survivors from competence, efficacious, loving advocacy?

## Disclaimer for contacting law enforcement

- best to put a boilerplate on voice messaging machine
	- 911 higher arrest rates for LGBTQ
	- esp trans women

## accesing resources in a community

We want to simultaneously *build* a vision and *end* violence. 

When we say a person might lie/use violence, what do we mean?

Ex: reading partner's email, mail, journal
- what do we expect if a person who abuses is doing it?
	- find out info about partner's finances
	- is my partner saving money? accumulating resources?
	- gaslighting: delusion of omnission
	- stealing bills to destroy credit
- what do we expect if a survivor of abuse does it?
	- gaslighting
	- accurate picture of financial situation

Ex: pressuring a partner to have sex
- from survivor
	- descalating a situation
	- demonstrating faithfulness, loyalty
	- getting money: putting out

## power/control wheels
[LBGTQ power & control wheel](http://www.ncdsv.org/images/TCFV_glbt_wheel.pdf)

critical topics
- batterers leverage the process of outing and "coming out"
	- interested in transition
	- GNC
	- trans, non-binary
	- friends, family, place of employment
	- coming out is not my choice but someone shares it
	- outing is a modern threat (since atleast the birth of the prison)
		- don't ask don't tell
		- families/employment ties severed *today*
		- don't have to *do* anything gay, just have to *be* gay
	- weaponized identities: no way to negotiate
	- what's a sure fire antidote to threats of outing: coming out
- batterers use "closeting" also
	- no learning or growing with other LGBTQ folks
	- prohibiting folks from coming out
	- you *can be with me* alone
	- you can't build power on a trans initiatives

- using vulnerabilities: playing off ideology
	- "men are strong, larger, more powerful"
	- "women are nuturing, etc"
	- batterers *use their vulnerabilities* to leverage pity

## conclusion

What to do instead of wallowing in tragedy? Offer a positive vision. Loving, vital, community-affirming, children-affirming, life-affirming relationships.

We don't really want "loving the sinner but hating the sin".

Folks to affirm family compositions, desires, etc. 

We're highly aware that communities (esp. religious communities) are willing to engage with queer folks if LQBTQ folks show up as "broken, looking to be healed".
