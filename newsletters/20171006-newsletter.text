I've attached the 10-day forecast for your review.

Before we enter cold weather, I want to meet all together at Gallery Boom. Here's a link to let me know what times you're available: https://goo.gl/forms/0tKuCd6PiO75cXNl2.

Shelter Events:
 
Fall Crafts 
with Karen Hall
Sat 10/8 1p--3p

Reading Hour

Lastly, our very own Whitney Trotta is planning to lead a group of clients to the Celebration of Sound Food Culture Summit on Sat 10/21. If you would like to accompany (as in, to eat delicious food), please email me---we have extra tickets!
