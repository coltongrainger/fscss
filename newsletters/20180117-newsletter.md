Hi all,

Please find a revised shelter forecast attached. I've focused on positions essential to our operation.

I am proud to report that 3 of our families have moved out of shelter (2 into permanent housing). In turn, we're bringing in new families based on their [vulnerability index](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homeless_Vulnerability_Index).

This Spring, I am going to emphasize additional training and workshops for active volunteers, some of which are listed below.
