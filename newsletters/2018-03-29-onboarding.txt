Hello Carrie Thunell,

Thank you for applying to help for Daytime and Greeter shifts at our shelter.

Would you please schedule 90 minutes to meet at shelter for an initial orientation?

Since volunteers are mandatory reporters, we'll talk a bit about reporting child abuse. Would you watch this video before we meet?
