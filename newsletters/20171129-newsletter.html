<p>We again require that parents obtain permission from the on-call staff person if they are going to leave the property without their kiddos. &gt; If they're going outside to smoke, they need to let the staff know who's watching their kids. If they're going off the property (without their kids) they need get permission from Keiya or the on-call. Only Keiya and the on-call can give permission for another family to babysit.</p>
