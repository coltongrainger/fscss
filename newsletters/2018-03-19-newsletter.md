Hi all,

Please find the forecast attached. 

A gentle reminder that cold weather shelter is only funded until April 30th,
after which we will revert to normal summer operation. In turn, we'll be
recruiting more volunteer hosts to fill in the gaps left by an absence of paid
staff.

Here is the schedule of upcoming trainings. We *strongly encourage* new volunteers
(who started in 2018) to attend two trainings: Part A and Part B. The remaining
trainings are suggested for everyone.

- Sat Apr 7 at 9:00a ([RSVP)](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSe5XxrA_-86eDYWccqwAb4wY0K_Mg4se_0sel5sTYloCI3QSg/viewform?usp=sf_link) | Volunteer Training: Part A | [Main Office][fsc]
