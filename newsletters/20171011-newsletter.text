Hello all,

Keiya and I will host a workshop Wednesday 10/18 4:45pm--6:15pm at Gallery Boom! (No need to RVSP---it's open to the public.) In response to questions about protocol, etc., we want to brainstorm a list of responsibilities for volunteers at shelter, especially moving into cold weather.

I have attached a 10-day forecast for review. 

Thanks!

-Colton

P.S. In general, I post events here: volunteer.fscss.org/events.
