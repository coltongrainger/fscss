<p>Gentle volunteers, interns, work-studies, staff, etc.,</p>
<p>I admonish you to dedicate a day this month <a href="https://www.volgistics.com/ex2/vicnet.dll?from=189830">to help at shelter</a>. Of 150 active volunteers, only 14 have signed up for shifts at shelter in January. I recognize much is happening, with classes and work resuming, but I want to emphasize that we can only serve 35 people long-term and an additional ~20 people overnight with <em>your help</em>.</p>
<p>At the same time, we're totally jazzed to bring on new volunteers, get families housed, and host the following events.</p>
<ul>
<li>Wed Jan 10 at 5:30p, STEM curriculum with Hannah Hillig</li>
<li>Thu Jan 11 at 3:30p, Jenny Fryers will discuss her research with survivors of assault. <strong><a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSe8dv84sO8DtfUYNxlRrj3s3QOg5qSxy8h7mwn4qDQv769qzw/viewform?usp=sf_link">RSVP</a></strong></li>
<li>Tue Jan 16 at 9:00a, Forest Preschool with Claire Petersen<br />
</li>
<li>Sun Jan 21 at 12:00p, Crafts with Karen Hall</li>
<li>Thu Jan 25 all day, <a href="http://www.commerce.wa.gov/serving-communities/homelessness/annual-point-time-count/">Point in Time Count</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Best,</p>
<p>-Colton</p>
