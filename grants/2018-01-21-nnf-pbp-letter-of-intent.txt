The Family Support Center and Nature Nurtures Forest Preschool are working in collaboration to start half day childcare on Tuesdays and Thursdays at Nature Nurtures Farm. The Family Support Center provides families experiencing homelessness overnight shelter at Pear Blossom Place, a warm and safe environment. Pear Blossom Place shelters up to 70 people during cold weather, and 36 throughout the year. Additionally, the Family Support Center manages 7 low-income apartments on the 2nd floor of Pear Blossom Place. Nature Nurtures Forest Preschool program provides care for young children between the ages of two to five and gives them the opportunity to interact with farm animals and nature in a safe and peaceful environment that fosters dignity, compassion and respect for all living things. This program especially benefits parents in their search for housing. Half day childcare for preschool aged children gives parents 3 hours of undivided time to consult with their case managers, complete rental applications, and attend to other administrative obligations (e.g., public benefits, resolving legal issues). <concluding sentence>


Our program is in need of waterproof rain gear and boots for the children to wear while they are at the farm for hygienic reasons. Some families experiencing homelessness do not have the ability to shower or wash their child’s clothing right away, so it is important that we do our best to keep the children clean and dry while still allowing them the freedom to play outdoors at our farm. Our program is in need of funding to continue to provide transportation and snacks to the children. During our pilot program Nature Nurtures Farm has worked to provide free transportation, snacks, and rain gear to borrow but will need financial assistance to continue to do so.
