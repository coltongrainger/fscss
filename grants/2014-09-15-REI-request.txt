Dear Mr. Barnet;

My name is Katherine Cox and I’m an AmeriCorps VISTA member with the Family Support Center of South Sound, located in downtown Olympia, WA. The mission of the Family Support Center is “Working Together to Strengthen All Families”. We provide supportive services to families, including supervised visitation, housing case management, domestic violence advocacy, family resource services, basic needs, rental assistance, in addition to operating the largest homeless family shelter in Thurston County, Pear Blossom Place: A Family Support Community. On July 1, 2014 the family shelter relocated into a newly renovated and remodeled building, now providing over thirty adults and children with a 24-hour shelter space. 

Because we value the quality of REI’s outdoor products and your business contributions, we are asking if you could donate the remaining products of your upcoming October garage sale to our organization. We always accept donations of sleeping bags, pillows, floor mats, cots, blankets, coats, gloves, shoes, hats, socks, and any other basic necessity item that families need. With the colder months approaching our organization will support more low-income and homeless families in need of many of these supplies and basic necessities. Your donations would directly support families in our community. 

Your donation is tax deductible and we will recognize you and your business for your support of families in Thurston County. 

Thank you for your considering our donation request. The Family Support Center and our families appreciate your contribution for the betterment of our community. 


With Kind Regards,

Katherine Cox
