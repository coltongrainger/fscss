Records Management Policy
Purpose
This policy provides for the systematic review, retention, and destruction of documents received or created by The Family Support Center of South Sound in connection with the transaction of The Family Support Center of South Sound’s business. This policy covers all records and documents, regardless of physical form, contains guidelines for how long certain documents should be kept and how records should be destroyed. The policy is designed to ensure compliance with federal and state laws and regulations, to eliminate accidental destruction of records and to facilitate The Family Support Center of South Sound’s operations by promoting efficiency and sound records management practices.
To ensure the most efficient and effective operation of The Family Support Center of South Sound (“Agency”), we are implementing this Document Retention Policy. The records of the Agency are important to the proper function of the Agency. Our records include virtually all of the records you produce as an Agency employee. Such records can be in electronic or paper form. Thus, items that you may not consider important, such as interoffice emails, desktop calendars, and printed memoranda are records that are considered important under this policy. If you are ever uncertain as to any procedures set forth in this policy (e.g. what records to retain or destroy, when to do so, or how) it is your responsibility to seek answers from Agency Director/ designee.
The goals of this policy are to:
1. Retain important documents for reference and future use;
2. Delete documents that are no longer necessary for the proper functioning of the Agency;
3. Organize important documents for efficient retrieval; and 
4. Ensure that you, as an Agency employee, know what documents should be retained, the length of their retention, means of storage, and when and how they should be destroyed.
Federal and state laws require Agency to maintain certain types of records for particular periods. Failure to maintain such records could subject you and Agency to penalties and fines, obstruct justice, spoil legal evidence, and/ or seriously harm Agency’s position in litigation. Thus, it is imperative that you fully understand and comply with this, and any future records retention or destruction policies and schedules, UNLESS you have been notified by Agency, or if you believe that (1) such records are or could be relevant to any future litigation, (2) there is a dispute that could lead to litigation, or (3) Agency is a party to a lawsuit, in which case you MUST PRESERVE such records until Agency’s legal counsel determines that the records are no longer needed.
“Records” discussed herein refers to all business records of Agency (and is used interchangeably with “documents”), including written, printed, and recorded materials, as well as electronic records (i.e. emails and documents saved electronically). All business records shall be retained for a period no longer necessary for the proper conduct and functioning of Agency. No business records shall be retained longer than __10___years, EXCEPT those that (1) have periods provided for herein, (2) are in the Document Retention Schedule, found at Appendix “A”, or (3) are specifically exempted by Agency’s Director/ designee.
Management
To ensure compliance with this Document Retention Policy, Agency’s Director/designee is responsible for the following oversight functions:
Implementing the Document Retention Policy; 
Ensuring that employees are properly educated, understand, and follow the Document Retention Policy’s purpose;
Providing oversight on actual retention and destruction of documents;
Ensuring proper storage of documents; 
Periodically review to ensure proper retention periods are in place;
Ensuring the proper storage of documents;
Suspending the destruction of documents upon foreseeable litigation; and
Keeping employees and Board apprised of changes in relation to the Document Retention Policy.
Agency’s Director/designee shall annually review the Document Retention Program, modify it accordingly, and inform and educate all Agency employees on any such changes. All questions relating to document retention and/or destruction should be directly address to Agency’s Director/designee.
Types of Records
Appendix “A”, attached at the end of this Document Retention Policy, lists several categories of records, as well as specific records that contain specific retention periods.

Upon destruction or deletion, organize the final records (and duplicates) in a file marked “FINAL” and store them appropriately.

Such include, but are not limited to: documents given (or sent via electronic form) to any third party not employed by Agency, or government agency; final memoranda and reports; correspondence; handwritten telephone memoranda no further transcribed; minutes; journal entries; cost estimates; etc. All accounting records shall be deemed final.

Unless otherwise specified in the Document Retention Schedule, such records should be retained for the minimum of _10___years.
Historical Records
Historical records are those that are not longer of use to Agency, but by virtue of their age or research value may be of historical interest or significance to Agency.
Historical records shall be retained indefinitely.
Storage
Tangible Records
Tangible records are those in which you must physically move to store, such as paper records (including records printed versions of electronically saved documents), photographs, audios recordings, advertisements and promotional items. Active records and records that need to be easily accessible may be stored in Agency’s office space or equipment. Inactive records can be sent to Agency’s off-site facility.
Electronic Records
Electronic mail (“E-mail”) should be either printed and stored as tangible evidence, or download to a computer file and kept electronically or on a CD.
Agency has computer software that duplicates files, which are then backed-upon on additional server. If you have a notebook/laptop computer from Agency that you work on out of the office, your computer contains synchronization software that duplicates and backs-up files when you log into the network. However, it is important that all employees take precautionary measures to save work and records on Agency’s network drive.
If you save sensitive or important records on computer CDs, you should duplicate that information in an alternate format because CDs are easily lost or damaged.
Document Destruction/ Deletion
THE FAMILY SUPPORT CENTER OF SOUTH SOUND acknowledges its responsibility to preserve information relating to litigation, audits and investigations. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of July 30, 2002, makes it a crime to alter, cover up falsify, or destroy any document to prevent its use in an official proceeding.
Failure on the part of employees to follow this policy can result in possible civil and criminal sanctions against THE FAMILY SUPPORT CENTER OF SOUTH SOUND and its employees and possible disciplinary action against responsible individuals (up to and including termination of employment). Each employee has an obligation to contact the Executive Director of a potential or actual litigation, external audit, investigation or similar proceeding involving THE FAMILY SUPPORT CENTER OF SOUTH SOUND that may have an impact as well on the approved records retention schedule.
The Family Support Center of South Sound’s Director/ designee is responsible for the ongoing process of identifying its records, which have met the required retention period and overseeing their destruction. Destruction of financial, personnel, client, and deemed confidential will be accomplished by shredding.
Document destruction will be suspended immediately, upon any indication of an official investigation, audit, or when a lawsuit is filed or appears imminent. Destruction will be reinstated upon conclusion of such action. 



Tangible Records
Tangible records should be destroyed by shredding or some other means that will render them unreadable. If you have a record that you do not know how to destroy, such as a photograph, compact disk, or tape recording, ask the advice of Agency’s Director/designee.
Electronic Records
Electronic documents will be retained as if they were paper documents. Therefore, any electronic files, including records of donations made on online, that fall into one of the document types on the above schedule will be maintained for the appropriated amount of time. 
E-mail records that you “delete” remain in the Agency’s system. Thus, Agency’s IT designee will be responsible for permanently removing deleted emails from the computer system.
Deleting files and emptying the recycling bin is usually sufficient in most circumstances to get rid of a record. However, because electronic records can be stored in many locations, Agency’s IT designee will be responsible for permanently removing deleted files from the computer system.
Keep in mind, where duplicate records are involved, both copies must be destroyed/deleted where proper.
Cessation of Record Destruction/Deletion
If a lawsuit is filed or imminent, or a legal document request has been made upon Agency, ALL RECORD DESTRUCTION MUST CEASE IMMEDIATELY. Agency’s Director/designee may suspend this Document Retention Policy to require that documents relating to the lawsuit or potential legal issue(s) be retained and organized. A critical understanding of the section is imperative. Should you fail to follow this protocol, you and/or Agency may be subject to fines and penalties, among other sanctions.
Disaster recovery
The Family Support Center of South Sound’s records will be stored in a safe, secure, and accessible manner. Documents and financial files that are essential to keeping The Family Support Center of South Sound’s operating in an emergency will be duplicated or backed up at least every week. 
This disaster recovery policy covers general computer equipment, connectivity, data security, and other general office equipment. In summary, the FSC uses all Commercial Off The Shelf (COTS) software in it’s operations as well as generally available PCs, servers and network connectivity.  Data is stored centrally and backed up offsite automatically.  This allows the FSC the flexibility to simply purchase new equipment and software, download the data and resume operations following an incident. 
In detail:

1) The FSC Local Area Network (LAN) is implemented via a traditional Ethernet LAN, Hubs, Routers, etc. and is serviced by a dedicated file server running Microsoft Small Business Server.
2) All important data, computer files, databases, etc. is stored on the file server and is automatically backed up to a commercially available, geographically separated data backup service via the Internet.
3) Key paper documents are scanned and recorded on the central server. 
4) Should fire or theft or other hazards render components of the computer system or the entire system inoperative or unavailable, replacement products (PCs, servers, software, connectivity) are readily available commercially. 
5) Employees have been trained to not store important files on their local PCs.  Occasionally scans are conducted of employee workstations to ensure compliance with this policy.
6) The FSC email is managed by Microsoft Exchange Server and it’s datastore is on the file server.
7) Norton antivirus software is used to help prevent infections.
8) The FSC has insurance to cover replacement costs of software and equipment following a disaster. 
9) Other office equipment such as fax machines, printers, copiers, etc. are also readily available commercially. 
10) Accounting files are managed by an outside book keeper using quickbooks.  The book keeper backs up the quickbooks database regularly and stores these backups off site. In addition, the executive director, treasurer and entire board of trustees get financial reports on a monthly basis. 

Compliance
Failure on the part of the employees to follow this policy can result in possible civil and criminal sanctions The Family Support Center of South Sound and its employees and possible disciplinary  action against responsible individuals.
