Under President G.W. Bush, ICE agents routinely used a range
of deceptive tactics, known as ruses, to enter homes or workplaces. In 2005
and 2006, for the first time, ICE issued two memoranda setting guidelines for
ICE agents’ use of deception. 38 The memos explicitly prohibited ruses that
involved health and safety programs (e.g. pretending that they were workers
checking on a gas leak) or agents identifying themselves as representatives
of “another agency (federal, state
or local) or that of a private entity”
without prior permission. In practice,
however, officers regularly raided
homes by identifying themselves as
“police,” asserted they were looking for
an individual other than the purported
target, pretended to be investigating
a crime such as identity theft, and
even claiming an emergency inside
that required their entry. Once inside,
ICE agents would arrest anyone in the
home at risk of deportation. 

Under Obama, when attempting to arrest people in the
community, ICE agents generally:
— Work in teams
— Arrive early in the morning to homes (e.g. between 5am and 8am)
— Have only an “administrative” warrant 39 signed by a supervisor
at ICE rather than a judge
— Must get consent from a resident to look for someone in a home
because the agents usually do not have a warrant signed by a judge
authorizing entry
— Use surveillance and database research to locate and detain people
in public spaces outside of the home

 Under President Obama, ICE agents without judicial warrants
increasingly began to enter homes through deception, also known as “ruses.”
Agents trick residents into believing the officers are local police investigating
criminal matters, even announcing themselves as “police.” Residents—not
knowing the agents’ true purpose—often then help ICE locate a loved one
for deportation by letting ICE into the home or helping the officers arrange
a meeting with the person ICE eventually detains. ICE agents have also used
similar lies to call targeted people and lure them to specific public locations,
even going so far as to arrange meetings at NYPD precincts only to detain
the person outside. Pretending to be local police, ICE agents:

— Request help with a criminal investigation
. Ask residents to review photographs/mugshots of criminal suspects
. Use a stranger’s photograph but the targeted person’s name when
describing a criminal suspect, prompting residents to locate loved
ones to correct the error
. Claim someone is using a person’s name to commit crimes and
request to speak to the person to clear this up
. Say that a criminal suspect or fugitive has been using that address
or is in the vicinity and thus officers need to enter and search to
ensure the person is not present

— Claim that the targeted person has been the victim of identity theft
or fraud and they are investigating

— Call a targeted person to clear up an accusation and arrange a meeting
. Describe the person’s vehicle and claim they need to meet to inspect
it, as it is reported to have been in an accident
. Claim they need to inspect the individual’s body for signs of injury,
as s/he is suspected of having been in a fight reported to police
. Claim they need to see proof of compliance with a prior court case

What we may see under the Trump administration:
— An increase in the number of raids and agents conducting arrests
in communities
— A return to more sweeping raids with collateral arrests
(i.e., people who were not the initial target but nonetheless at risk
of deportation)
— Continued if not expanded use of force
— Continued use of ruses with evolving prompts
— More pressure on employers & others to turn people over to ICE
— More joint task force operations between local police and ICE
(e.g. gang task forces)

Legal Challenges
to ICE Raids
Anyone who has been subject to or has witnessed an ICE raid should
document what happened. The details of a raid can be useful for
the non-citizen’s legal case and can also be important to bring lawsuits
against the government for any abuses suffered.

This includes if agents:
— Entered the home without proper consent
— Searched the home without proper consent
— Dismissed medical or childcare concerns raised during arrest
— Harassed or threatened witnesses, including the use of racial profiling
— Engaged in abusive behavior related to your gender identity or sexual
orientation, including sexual harassment or derogatory remarks
— Used force (verbal or physical) or weapons against individuals

Important considerations before videotaping an arrest
in the home or in public:
. ICE agents are armed law enforcement officials who are first
and foremost concerned for their own safety. Before taking out a
recording device, it is best to assess the situation and determine
whether taking a video could escalate the situation and
endanger anyone present.
. It is extremely important that if you choose to record,
you must make it obvious that you are recording. Almost every
state has laws against “secret” recordings. Do not cover up, hide
or conceal your camera/phone.
. Your right to record law enforcement usually comes with the
qualification that you must not “interfere” as they are carrying out
their “duties.” This means you should stand severalfeet away
from any law enforcement action taking place if you choose
to record.

— File Suitfor ConstitutionalViolations by Federal Officers andAgents:
When agents or officers violate the Constitution—for example, by using
excessive force during a raid, or by racial profiling to make an arrest—
they can be sued individually in Bivens claims. 50 Bivens claims allow
victims of unconstitutional conduct by agents operating “under color
of law” (meaning those who act in their official capacity) to file suit in
federal court, seeking monetary damages for violations of constitutional
law. In some cases where it is shown to be a pattern of unconstitutional
behavior, suits can be broughtto stop the illegal conduct or stop
future illegal conduct. Suits can be brought not only against those who
personally conducted the raids, but also against their supervisors and
high-level officials who ordered or otherwise guided the conduct. 

See Bivens v. Six Unknown
Named Agents, 403 U.S. 388
(1971).
