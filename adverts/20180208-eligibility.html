<p>Hi all,</p>
<p>We're planning to continue offering free day care from 9a--12 noon Tuesdays and Thursdays through March. Day care is available for families enrolled in homeless family services at the Family Support Center or who are staying in the shelter or aparements at Pear Blossom Place.</p>
<p>Feel free to share info with other families that would benefit from this program.</p>
