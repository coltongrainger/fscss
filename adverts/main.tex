Our shelter, Pear Blossom Place, is kept open 24/7 by staff, interns, and volunteers. We need volunteers to help in the evenings and during the day on weekends. 

All volunteers are scheduled in pairs---consider signing up with a friend! We will provide a shelter orientation and an introduction to social services for families.

We also schedule volunteers to host regular activities, e.g., music lessons, early literacy, cooking, crafts. The best time to host events is during the \emph{evening shifts}.
