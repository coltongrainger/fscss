Dear Sisters and Brothers in Christ,
 
My name is Dagmar Growe, and I am a volunteer with the Family Support Center. I am writing to draw your attention to a desperate volunteer need in our community.
 
The Family Support Center operates the only shelter for homeless families in the county. Without Pear Blossom Place, somewhere between 15 and 25 children would have to spend the night sleeping outside or in cars each night. As most non-profit social service agencies, the Family Support Center operates on a shoe-string budget, and does not have funding for overnight and weekend staff. These have to be covered by volunteers.
 
In the past, many of those shifts have been covered by work-study students. For a number of reasons, this is not happening anymore, and the lack of volunteers is creating a critical and desperate situation. Staff members have had to cover night shifts, which mean they are less available during the day to provide much needed case management and other services which are designed to move families into permanent housing and keep them there. The fact that staff members are willing to give up their weekend time and nights multiple times a week speaks more then anything to their dedication to the families, but it is not sustainable situation, and will, I am sure, lead to burn-out, attrition, and further instability in the lives of the families they serve. Legally, the shelter is not allowed to operate without continuous staffing.
 
Volunteer shifts are not hard---as an overnight volunteer I have a choice between sleeping in a loft bed or on a cot in one of the staff offices. Families live in “apartments” of the main area, so after 9 pm things get pretty quiet. I usually get a good night’s sleep and I work the next day. My “work” at the shelter consists of controlling access to the building via an intercom, answering the phone (rarely), and hang out with guests as much as I feel ready to engage. Especially the kids tend to be eager for attention, but parents too can be glad for someone to listen. I don’t admit families to the shelter---this is done only by staff---and there is always a staff person on call in case of problems (although I can’t remember the last time I called).
 
Coverage is needed from 5pm to 7am on week nights and shifts are split between 2 greeters in the early evening, and 2 hosts who come in later and spend the night. Weekends require additional day-time coverage. Training is provided, and background checks are required, so there would need to be some regular commitment. If your congregation could assemble a team of 6--8 people and commit to covering 2 nights each month it would make a huge difference. However, I do find that my volunteering becomes more rewarding when I volunteer weekly, as I get to know the families a little better.
 
For me, spending the night at the shelter has become rewarding way to put my faith into action and follow Jesus’ call to serve. I am asking you to share this opportunity with your congregation and prayerfully consider your response. Please contact [Colton Grainger](mailto:coltong@fscss.org) at the Family Support Center for more information.
 
Blessings,
 
Dagmar Growe
