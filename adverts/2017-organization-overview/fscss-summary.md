The Family Support Center of South Sound is a nonprofit 501c3 social service agency located in downtown Olympia, Washington: "Working together to strengthen all families."

We envision a community where all families are valued and nurtured and have the resources to be strong, healthy, and self-sufficient. 

The Family Support Center is a lead agency fighting to prevent family homelessness in Thurston County. We provide emergency shelter, housing assistance, case management, legal advocacy, computer and phone access, warm clothes, food, hygiene supplies, transportation, and employment assistance.
