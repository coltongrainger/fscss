I'd like to ask an open question: how does our organization intend to support folks with bikes?

Looking at the Evergreen sustainability binder, PBP was intended to hold quite a few bikes: there are 5 hanging racks and 3 standing racks inside, as well as a large a bike rack outside. But in practice, how do we store bikes? how do our clients use bikes? do we need to move the bike hangers to a more convenient, accessible location? do we need to set some expectations as to where bikes will be stored?

## volgistics

- vic net login; I always just go in as Keiya so I can see the schedule easily. (maybe give my pw?) 
- Please make sure there's always 2 host shifts on the schedule. 

## KYG volunteers

Know Your Government (KYG) is a civic education program open to 9th-12th grade youth from across our state. Each county is invited to bring a delegation to this conference where they will be part of active learning adventures focused on Washington State government as well as the skills and knowledge necessary for being a positive contributor within their community.  During their 4 days in Olympia, these motivated and high-achieving students will also be experiencing the process of how a bill becomes a law and meet with the legislators from their respective districts.

The KYG planning team is in need of organizations in Olympia who could provide these youth the opportunity to complete a 3 hour community service project on Monday, February 19th from 1pm-4pm.  The efforts they contribute could include letter writing, the assembly of kits/packages, organization, creating art/crafts that could be given to the organization's clients or staff, cleaning, or any other project/task that would help your program.  

After reading about the services that Family Support Center offers, would something like an organization project, landscaping, reading/tutoring/workshop assistance, creating a mural, preparing promotional activities, display/supply set up, or adding a fresh coat of paint to a room be something you could allow our youth delegates to help with?  The number of youth that help at your site would be determined by you based on your projects.  Our group would be well supervised by county chaperones who have completed WSP background checks. I would be happy to answer any questions and help make this opportunity possible. To allow for time for planning and informing our county delegations about the service activities that they can be part of, we are asking that you let us know if you can help us by Friday, January 12th. 

Thank you!

Mon 2/19 from 1p--4p is open to volunteer cleaning either at our shelter or unpacking, sorting, and distributing goods at our main office. I'll ask that at least one chaperone submits a nominal volunteer application at volunteer.fscss.org.

We could accommodate 20 delegates in the donation room and 10 delegates at shelter.

KYG sounds similar to a camp that I coordinated for some time in Idaho (Boys/Girls State); how many delegates do you expect to attend?

This year, students from across the state will be bringing their own perspectives on topics such as homelessness. Prior to the conference, they have been researching these social issues in order to provide those at the conference with key points to consider as we vote on bills currently being processed by our legislators. It will be interesting to see how the discussions develop.  

Also, we have more delegates than expected registered for KYG this year, Is there any possible way that you could accept your original number of 30? Please let us know.

## Natalie on Cold Weather Shelter

We're halfway through Cold Weather season! Hooray! Well done :)

Couple quick check ins and reminders.... 

This week Keiya is out of town for a family emergency. Please do not contact her. If you have an emergency or question during your shift, call your on call person. 

We have a new volunteer coordinator, Tara Jackson. She's working part time and is diligently working with Colton to fill all of our volunteer shifts. We need to be running every night with 2 greeters, 2 hosts, and a cold weather person. Volunteers need access to the two offices with bunk beds; they are able to sleep (it's how we keep 'em!) and should have priority access to those rooms. Please also prioritize volunteers working at the front desk space until they head to bed; they can be your eyes and ears to let people in, help answer phones etc. They like to feel needed and wanted, so giving them tasks that support shelter as a whole is really important. 

You as cold weather staff can use the far right office, which is Keiya's. If you have kiddos that you bring with you during your shift, we welcome that, and I ask that you please use Keiya's office to put them to sleep. You're welcome to grab some of the cold weather mats and set up a sleeping space in that office. 

During down time please help keep up on laundry, shelter cleaning and organizing, and other small projects Keiya may ask for help with. 

The shelter website is critical, and needs to be accurate. I need to be able to easily see who showed up for cold weather, and who no showed. I would ideally like it to say next to each family's name if they arrived or no showed. N/A or a * isn't helpful or clear. The website is considered an agency document, so needs to be clear and accurate. 

It's also imperative that you update the Cold Weather Task force Spreadsheet. In the top portion of the sheet you need to give our number of guests in the year round shelter (rooms 101-106). Then, in the "cold weather shelter" section, put how many people showed for cold weather. That number should match the shelter website. 

I am in meetings weekly and that spreadsheet is always discussed (elected officials, service providers, clients...) and it's so important for it to be accurate. 

If you have any questions, don't hesitate to reach out. Thanks so much!

Natalie

Our workstudy Brina let me know that families have been missing out of the monthly birthday parties. Brina, Kristi and Mary (the librarian) thought that a group meal might bring the community together.

## executive summary

- To maintain a reputation for "service learning", every intern/workstudy needs supervision.
- Moving the shelter schedule to volgistics could save 103.608 hours/month of managerial time.
- I'm starting group volunteer training at shelter, the library, the main office.

## service learning


> The armies separated; and, it is said, Pyrrhus replied to those giving him praise for victory: **one other such victory would utterly undo him.** For he had lost a great part of the forces he brought with him, and almost all his particular friends and principal commanders; there were no others there to make recruits, and he found the confederates in Italy backward.
-Plutarch, [Life of Pyrrhus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parallel_Lives)

- without supervision, attrition
- matching *everyone* at shelter with meaningful challenges
- working at shelter has a low signal to noise ratio (10% showtime 90% downtime)
- skilled volunteers get bored with the lack of challenging projects

a recent volunteer application reads
> Statement of Interest
>  
> 1. I learned about Family Support Center through my school's website. I attend WSU Global Campus.
> 
> 2. I am applying to volunteer as a class requirement for WSU Human Development Family in Poverty Class. Also, I am applying because I would like to make a difference and I have a passion for working with children. I will complete my BS in Psychology this year and I attend to apply for my masters in order to pursue a career as a school psychologist.

unified shelter scheduling
- Can all essential personel be scheduled in Volgisitics? 
- Rather than having 1/2 the interns scheduled randomly, Shilo too, then CW also scheduled randomly, with a lot of cross over (oh, she's work-study today but an intern tomorrow).
- 

phone tree for PBP backup

> > That's something the on call should be able to cover, Lexus emailed but told her to call shelter and let them know. 
> Yes I think something should be in place. I never heard she wasn’t coming in; not sure who she contacted. I would expect that whenever someone hears a volunteer cancelled they let staff at pbp know and a backup person is contacted. Did Lexus speak with someone? We can also remind volunteers they should speak w a live person or get a text back of confirmation when they cancel their shift. `

## volunteering vs. service learning

## shelter scheduling

Making a specific shelter schedule for "essential staff" may reduce stress more than other organizational changes.

My Goal: (i) use a schedule to avoid *over-staffing* and *under-staffing*, also to give *clear start and stop times*; (ii) pull the schedule to the website automatically.

From Ruotsalainen, et al., *[Preventing occupational stress in healthcare workers](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25482522).* Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (8 December 2014), doi:10.1002/14651858.cd002892.pub5:
> We categorised interventions as cognitive-behavioural training (CBT) (n = 14), mental and physical relaxation (n = 21), combined CBT and relaxation (n = 6) and organisational interventions (n = 20). We categorised outcomes as stress, anxiety or general health.
> 
> Organisational interventions consisted of changes in working conditions, organising support, changing care, increasing communication skills and changing work schedules. *Changing work schedules (from continuous to having weekend breaks and from a four-week to a two-week schedule) reduced stress* with standardized mean idfference 0.55 (2 trials, 180 participants). *Other organisational interventions were no more effective than no intervention* or an alternative intervention.

- who to schedule? 
- YES: greeters, hosts, cold weather
- MAYBE: daytime? interns? front desk staff regularly?
	- some responsibility is lost by  *floating* staff in multiple roles

- lost time. 
	- Colton loses 10 minutes, Keiya loses 20 minutes, each day, wondering who's on the schedule
	- 0.5 hours * 5hours/week * 4.33 weeks/month = 103.608 hours/month 
	- could be used for supervision, training, etc

	- Share how we feel we benefit the shelter, any ideas of improvement, struggles we have, get to know each other and our motivations
	- I'm a new volunteer so I want to meet fellow volunteers and hear about their experiences.
	- discuss consistency, for instance, the use of computer; set a time limit and stick to it. it doesn't matter if child is the only one in the common area. if 
kids begin to bang on the keyboard, argue or crowd each other; give 1 warning. then unplug it.
	- Hearing about what is going on at the shelter since I have become disconnected by working a full time swing job and taking weekend classes, plus dealing with a medical issue.
	- I am not sure what this is but enjoy the fellowship and art
	- I truly want to hear other peoples ideas. I haven't really been volunteering for very long and would like input of how I can be better.

## Volunteer Program

### Recruitment

In terms of drumming up motivation to volunteer, I focus either *for children* or *for families*. We can help kids avoid adverse childhood experiences. We can help families manage competing (often insurmountable?) obligations.
> Today the emphasis is on keeping together families that would have been separated in the past. These families have complex needs, often involving some sort of child maltreatment, substance abuse, or children exhibiting oppositional behavior or deliquency in the home, school, and community[^crosson]. The goal of family preservation programs are to: allow children to remain safely [housed], maintain and strengthen family bonds, stabilize the crisis situation that precipitated any need for outside placement, increase the family's coping skills and competencies, and facilitate the family's use of appropriate and information helping resources.

How to rank family support in terms of [cause prioritization?](https://causeprioritization.org/_categories) I think it's important to compile examples of long term successes (i.e., improved cognition after removal from a traumatic environment, increased standard of living, decreased ecological footprint, advocacy for survivors of violence, dialogue surrounding violence). Should I demonstrate that shelter (with each client here for an average of 120 days) disrupts and reframes the "coordinates of social reality"?

> The act, therefore, "always involves a radical risk ... it is a step into the open, with no gauranee about the final outcome." This is not because of the suppposed complexity of a situation, our inability to accurately predict the consequences of an intervention, but because "an act retroactively changes the very coordinates into which it itervenes" and so retroactively also creates (or fails to create) the conditions of its legitimation. It is for this reason that the same gesture can come to be seen as a genuine act or as a "ridiculous empty posture
", depending on whether and how the socio-symbolic coordinates have changed in the wake of the act itself. (Jason Glynos, Ch. 12, *Lacan, Discourse, Event: New Psychoanalytic Approaches to Textual Indeterminacy.* [source](https://books.google.com/books?id=Cu_eAQAAQBAJ&pg=PA152)

What about locality? Does proximity to shelter provide stronger imperative to volunteer? I think only so much as effort directed towards a community social support system is multiplied when focused locally. In other words, local volunteers have a comparative advantage to non-local (external) workers charged to "aid" and "reform" a community. 

What about individual "turning points"? Persons in recovery from substance abuse (or from addiction in a more general sense) could be motivated to mentor or sponsor others in fulfillment of an obligation to return services rendered. I am personally most responsive to arguments that shelter creates the space for healing (which I take literally, thinking in terms of cognitive plasticity).
