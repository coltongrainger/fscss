Who's here? VISTA supervisors, VISTAs and the CNCS state directors (Tom & Monica). 

We played a matching game, where each person wrote a unique fact about themself and placed it in a hat. I placed "I love greek orthodox iconography" in the hat. Keiya wrote "I nearly joined a covenant". Then, each person drew from the hat, the first person guessing which person matched the fact. The next person to draw was the person whose fact was just drawn (ensuring that nobody drew their own card, also narrowing the possible suspects for the next draw). With 40 participants, the game lasted about 30 minutes.

No more monthly bus passes from UWTC. VISTA members are to collect bus passes from their own agency.

Stacy Hicks asked for anecdotal stories, volunteer hours, and resources fund-raised. Later, I submitted a compilation of hours & resources to Keiya, estimated.

- 88 volunteers recruited
- 195 volunteers managed
- 1500 service hours recruited
- 2700 service hours managed
- $0 cash resources
- $6500 in-kind resources

Cynthia, a previous VISTA, facilitated a Non-Violent Communication activity. We practiced actively listening to a set of complaints, then responding with non-violent [statement](https://nvcnextgen.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/nvc-mandala.jpg) as to the [root causes](http://www.nonviolentcommunication.com/pdf_files/feelings_needs.pdf) of the complaint.

Tom and Monica presented on the new VISTA handbook. They summarized that
- VISTAs have 10 personal days and 10 sick days (off from their worksite)
- Professional development does not count as personal hours
- VISTAs cannot extend their service past 4 months without a 1 year re-enroll
- jury duty is not required to count as personal or medical 
- holidays follow site holidays (12/25, 12/25, 1/1)

Stacy expects to have a new VISTA lead by January. At the same time, Natalie and Keiya expect to hire another volunteer coordinator by January.
