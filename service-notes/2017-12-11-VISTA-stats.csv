10,50,100,500, $ -   , $ 200.00 ,"I've (i) ""leaned"" the volunteer program, (ii) made the application process as transparent as possible (it's almost paperless), and (iii) focused on providing quality volunteer orientations. I have dedicated perhaps 1/10 of my time to recruitment. Here's the up-shot: every future volunteer will face substantially fewer barriers to entry into our program, and the program is now more transparent. ",- built volunteer.fscss.org  - streamlined application process  - created new orientation  - represented FSCSS at the CFD  - pamphleted TESC and St Martin's Abbey  - repainted shelter with DOC volunteer ground,We are consistently short staffed. This would be manageable if our volunteers and staff shared the same calendars. We need improve communication between volunteers and FSCSS staff.,"Increased transparency of staff work schedules, e.g., when are staff scheduled to work at shelter? If I can see where the schedule is already filled (by staff, who don't use the same calendar), I can prioritize on filling *real* gaps in coverage.",Continued group meetings.,volunteer.fscss.org/yolanda-frederick,Thanks for the support!
