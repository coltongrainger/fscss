## Incident Reports

Electronic form: https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSea_vVLzfiE70EvqeUa1G4BilgGLE1JknYEdQEO43TxEuJIkg/viewform?usp=sf_link

What is an "incident"? Besides setting good precedent for supervision, incident reports are available for legal protection/prosecution.

- physical injury, contacting EMS
- encounter with law enforcement
  - needs box for cause number
  - needs area for follow up?
- damage to property

## Emergency Notifications

This application is for notifcations in case of fire alarms, active shooters, lock downs, and other safety notifications. We'd like partner agencies to enroll with Remind on their cell phones.

### Lock-downs

- Note: Pear Blossom Place and the FSCSS Main Office are likely to go on lock-down together.
- Open question: who's the designated person to make sure the doors are locked?
- Jeff S and Amanda K will attend an active shooter training in Renton.
- Can we have a active shooter training via Mason County sheriff's office at Pear Blossom Place during the Summer?
- For active shooter trainings, FSCSS would like Thurston County sheriff's office to be involved.

- contact Amanda King (amandak@fscss.org) for trivial building requests
