Could y'all help Keiya and Jeff pass the site inspection in the morning?

## Atrium

- Clean hand prints off of windows
- Trash unclaimed bags of clothing

## Kitchen and Pantry

- Put away any dangerous knifes if left out in the morning
- Trash unclaimed items upon the pantry (potentially use the rubbermade
  tupperware to collect extra items)

## Bathrooms

- Clean toilet bowls
- Clean sink basin
- Clean mirrors
- Refill paper towels
- Empty trash cans

Thank you!
