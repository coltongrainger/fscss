\opening{SUBJECT: Two Weeks' Notice for Termination of VISTA service}

Today I give notice that I will terminate my VISTA service at the end of the day March \nth{16}, 2018.

I have expressed grievances that were not resolved in adequate time, namely
\begin{itemize}
\item I am not willing to run trainings beyond $4$ hours in length, and
\item I am not willing to recruit volunteers without server side access to a \text{*.fscss.org} domain.
\end{itemize}

\closing{All the best in future endeavours,}
