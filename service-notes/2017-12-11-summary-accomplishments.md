I got oriented with volunteer coordination. I homogenized our application process. I archived former volunteer records. I created a draft website for volunteer recruitment. I pruned our volunteer database.

I've (i) "leaned" the volunteer program, (ii) made the application process as transparent as possible (it's almost paperless), and (iii) focused on providing quality volunteer orientations. I have dedicated perhaps 1/10 of my time to recruitment. Here's the up-shot: every future volunteer will face substantially fewer barriers to entry into our program, and the program is now more transparent.

I continued to maintain website: volunteer.fscss.org. I hosted 5 events to train volunteers, building momentum for more trainings & workshops. I attended 2 career fairs. I continued meeting individually with volunteers to provide guidance and feedback. I requested specific donations for shelter. I began writing a shelter safety plan.

I supported photographers during a festive portrait-taking event for FSC clients. I facilitated two courses in the prevention of childhood sexual abuse. I met two large groups of volunteers in the donation room, and scheduled volunteers daily for our shelter. I have networked with local colleges to promote internships and work-study positions. I began writing service-based learning syllabi for interns from the Evergreen State College. I have uploaded my VISTA working documents to an online repository.
