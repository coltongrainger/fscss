## How to enroll in classes during VISTA service?

The policy states that there is no longer written approval required from our office. However, before enrolling in any class, VISTAs and VISTA Leaders must discuss specific plans for enrollment with you. The conversation should include the number of credit hours intended to be taken, the period of time of the class or classes, and the course schedule (including dates and times when classes are scheduled). If after that discussion you have concerns, then you should talk to us. The classes must not interfere with VISTA service.
 
Also note that VISTAs while taking classes are prohibited from: engaging in full-time or part-time employment; and, receiving monetary compensation in addition to the living allowance and travel related reimbursements from VISTA/CNCS. Things such as paid work study, fellowships, and paid internship programs are not allowed during enrollment in classes.
 
Here is some language from the guidance around when to contact us. These are examples when the project supervisor must notify the CNCS State Office: a) despite the discussion the VISTA had with the project supervisor, the VISTA still expresses an intent to enroll in classes that take place in the course of regular VISTA duty hours; or b) despite the discussion, the VISTA still expresses an intent to enroll as a full-time student in classes, requiring the dedication of many hours per week to classwork, not VISTA service.
