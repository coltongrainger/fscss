Description:

Selected team members will provide supportive services to children removed from their homes and placed into state care due to allegations of neglect or abuse. You will facilitate scheduled visits between these children and their parents by transporting to/from the visit location in your own vehicle, monitoring the visit and documenting the interaction. This vital service helps maintain family bonds and is a key part in informing the social working in the court case.

You will remain with the child at all times, supervise the visit to ensure the childâ€™s well-being, intervene when necessary, communicate visitation guidelines to the visiting parent(s) while observing and accurately recording what happened during the visit. These visits will often take place at our Tumwater facility but can also happen at other locations such as the DSHS offices, local parks or libraries.

Available hours will be primarily evening and weekend hours. Both full-time and part-time opportunities are available.

Applicants must have at least a year and half of documented experience working with children in a professional setting (not your own children or family), have good written and oral communication skills, and the ability to work with people of all backgrounds.

Requirements:

Ability to work evenings and one weekend day
A flexible schedule to accommodate the needs of the children
Must possess a high school diploma, GED or college degree
Must be at least 21 years of age
Clearance of DSHS state criminal background check required
Valid Driver's License with a clean driving record
