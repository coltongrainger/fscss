\opening{To Whom It May Concern,}

	Ashley Milner has volunteered and interned at the Family Support Center's shelter since October 2017. The Family Support Center is a 501(c)(3) non-profit that serves families with children (or parents expecting children) experiencing housing instability. We serve clients regardless their demographic background.\footnote{See \url{http://volunteer.fscss.org/legal} for the full volunteer agreements.} Until last year, the Family Support Center provided supervised visitation. The program was discontinued, but our mission remains: \emph{Working together to strengthen all families.} It follows that Ashley's volunteer experience gives her formidable preparation for work as a visitation monitor.
	
	As a volunteer, Ashley exceeded expectations: in addition to being timely and professional in her conduct with our clients, Ashley often brought homecooked meals to share at shelter. Moreover, Ashley has demonstrated ability to de-escalate conficts between children and between adults. Lastly, Ashley is a keen observer, and I have appreciated her constructive feedback on agency policies and volunteer practices at shelter. 

	As a intern pursuing a degree in social work, Ashley sought out work at shelter to balance her studies at Pacific Lutheran University. She draws insightful parallels between our shelter and broader themes in social work, for example, how racial biases continue to affect understanding of parenting and early childhood education. I would be excited to hire Ashley as she continues her studies and achieves more mature insight to professional social services.
