## What is the best experiential option for your organization?

> Experiential Learning provides students with direct experience through which they can use analytical skills
and reflection to apply new ideas gained from the experience to their classroom learning. Experiential
learning includes internships, service learning, and various practicum opportunities. Determine what the
best fit for the organization is by considering the following definitions:
> - A **volunteer** is a person who performs a service willingly, without pay or credit in order to support a cause.
> - **Service Learning** is curriculum‐based emphasizing hands‐on learning while addressing real world
concerns. The service experience provides a context for translating discipline based theories into practice.
> - **Civic Engagement** offers a broad concept of community involvement and awareness that can include
service, advocacy, service learning, volunteerism and political participation, with the goal of helping to
develop community based knowledge, values and skills.
> - **Capstone/Project Based Learning** courses are the culmination of learning in the major. A student generally
works on a single large project‐‐such as a thesis paper or large research project‐‐for the entire semester.
> - **Externships** (Job Shadow) provide an initial exposure to a career for a brief period of time (such as one
day a week or a couple hours per week) by having students “shadow” an experienced employee or
professional. Externships may include academic credit when connected to a course.
> - **Internships** are defined by the National Association of Colleges and Employers (NACE) as: “a form of
experiential learning that integrates knowledge and theory learned in the
classroom with practical application and skills development in a professional
setting. Internships give students the opportunity to gain valuable applied
experience and make connections in professional fields they are considering
for career paths; and give employers the opportunity to guide and evaluate
talent.” In addition, an internship is a semester (fall, spring, summer) in
duration, may or may not carry credit, may be paid or unpaid based on the
Department of Labor criteria (See Page 8 for DOL Requirements).
> - A **Student Employee** is a person who is hired to provide services to an
organization on a regular basis in exchange for compensation, not for
academic credit.
