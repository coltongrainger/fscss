## todo
- look at VISPDAT, HOPE scale, ACE survey for additional questions (6,7,17,10,34--36 on VISPDAT)
- expand questions (as many as you want) then boil down to 10--15 questions
- needs purpose of survey (maybe use tags), confidentiality statement,  and your contact info at the top.
- focusing 10% on demographics (you can look in Apricot), 50% on education info, and 40% on adversities.
- including sections for single adults to take the survey as if they were back in school? or if their children are not in school, asking about expectations?

## what I can do
- set up a drop box
- print extras
- schedule time for you to come to CW shelter (if you want)

## incentives?
- maybe 2 $10 gift cards for local coffee shops (Burial Grounds, Olympia Coffee Roasters).
