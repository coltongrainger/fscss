## Confidentiality Statement

Each of the parties to this educational
contract recognize the sensitivity of the client information acquired
during client-provider interactions and therefore agree to maintain and
protect the confidentiality of client information and records. Although
the educational nature of the experience may necessitate discussion of
client/provider interactions, under no circumstance will the identity of
any individual client be disclosed beyond the student, practicum
liaison, and practicum instructor relationship, and then only when
necessary.

## BSW PRACTICUM LEARNING CONTRACT

and families), mezzo activities (e.g. plan, organize and lead/co-lead a
support, educational or therapy group; serve on agency committee; work
on a task or multidisciplinary team), and macro activities (e.g.
participate in program planning and/or evaluation, policy analysis,
legislative advocacy, community organizing, coalition building, grant
