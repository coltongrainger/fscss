	- Connie is carrying out her internship as part of an academic program at the Evergreen State College called “Student Originated-Studies: Community-Based Work in a Challenging Time.” Offered in collaboration with Evergreen’s Center for Community-Based Learning and Action (CCBLA), the program builds skills for community-based work and offers a collaborative space to share experiences and learning with other students doing internships or independent projects with organizations or community groups. Students engage in a 4-credit academic core, which includes readings, discussions, assignments, and workshops, all geared towards helping students reflect on and builds skills in community-based work.
	- I plan to gather my research through consented interviews, ethnographic research, note taking, readings, documentaries, and discussions to write an article that hopefully can be published in Olympia through a local service. I want to also learn how to give back to Pear Blossom through my time and working with people, I want to be able to help Pear Blossom become better and gather opinions through my research to better it.
