## Related Experience

> Currently I volunteer at the Pear Blossom Family Center in Olympia, Washington where I am turning my volunteer hours into an internship in which I will get credit. Along with interning I will do an independent research project where I take detailed notes in a journal about my experiences and observations of the Family Center. Observations of what is good within the facility, what is bad, what needs to be changed, etc. I want to be able to benefit the family center and help them further themselves. Using texts such as International Perspectives of Homelessness by Valerie Polakow, The Portable Nietzsche by Fredrich Wilhelm, Down and Out, on the Road by Kenneth L. Kusmer. I believe I have enough texts to further my observations and gain a historical perspective of homelessness that can relate to today's views of homelessness. I will be able to analyze these concepts using past experiences of analytical research, reading, writing about certain topics of interests. I am prepared and well ready for this research on my own. I am excited :)

## Obligations as a Field Supervisor

## Objectives

> i have already been volunteering at Pear Street Family Center. I want to do 4 credits worth of interning at Pear Blossom doing two sessions a week for 4-6 hours a week for the quarter. I would also like to create and put together and independent project relating to the internship. I want to spend 2 extra credits working on an independent project with sociology by studying the interpretation of homelessness through books written by credited authors. I hope that sounds good to you and to talk to you further.

> I want to study some ethnographic research done by a student in England who studied homelessness through ethnography. I want to read Kenneth Kusmer's: Down and Out, on the Road: The Homeless in American History, and study international perspectives and views on homelessness. I like Malthus's work and will totally look deeper into what he's written. I would love your help on this project too!

## Time Commitment

> I had a meeting with Catalina who is the professor guiding me through the internship on Evergreen's behalf. I am wondering if you would be able to be my sponsor at Pear Blossom and able to read my learning adjectives? Catalina said I need a sponsor through Pear Blossom who will also monitor some of my work. I am going to do 5 hours of interning at Pear Blossom and spend four other hours working on project with sociology and history of homeless. I can send you the names of the books and I will have a paper about my goals through the internship and my readings.

## Background 

> > Hope this message finds you well. You are receiving this message because you have expressed interest in taking the program “Student-Originated Studies: Community-Based Work in a Challenging Time” and have spoken with me or have made plans to speak with me to discuss your proposed internship or independent project for the winter.
> >
> > I am really excited about the program, and there has been a lot of interest from students. The program may end up filling up. So that students can plan their winter quarter appropriately, I am letting you know that seats will be reserved in this order: 1) students who are currently enrolled in the program, 2) students who contacted me and discussed their proposed internships before the academic fair, 3) students who discuss their proposed internships or projects during the academic fair, 4) everyone who contacts me after the fair.
> >
> > Since you have all contacted me in advance: if you are still interested in taking the program, please send me your Evergreen ID # so I can do the signature override in the system and you can register in the program when registration opens. When you send me your ID#, please also send me a brief reminder of what you want to do, including number of hours per week: (“I plan to work with X organization for Y number of hours per week. My main activities will be A, B, and C.” If you plan to combine two different things, you can also add: “In addition, I am hoping to do M credits of independent work on N project.”)
> >
> > I will be sending a more detailed letter once students are registered (around week 10) outlining what you need to do to prepare for the start of the quarter. Since these are internships and/or independent projects, you will need to do some preparatory work so we are ready to roll on day 1 of the quarter.
