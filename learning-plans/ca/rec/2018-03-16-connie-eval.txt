Connie interned 5 hours a week for 10 weeks at shelter. Her expressed goal was to understand ``issues [clients face] within the public system'' of housing.

At the outset of her internship, Connie planned (i) to conduct interviews with our clients, volunteers, and staff, and (ii) to situate these interviews within global perspectives of homelessness. 

I believe Connie succeeded in characterizing some of the historical antecedents of staff's and clients' beliefs about homelessness, e.g., see her literature review.

Connie did take on more responsibility throughout her internship, as evinced by her interviews with Femme-identifying persons experiencing homelessness in the community. After writing a proper consent form, Connie's work was entirely self-motivated and self-scheduled.

To leave behind a resource at shelter, Connie condensed information shared by word of mouth onto a map of the Olympia downtown area, with a corresponding directory of phone numbers and hours. 

In terms of relevant skills for Connie's prospective career (she's already prompted me for a rec letter to graduate programs in Anthropology), while working at our shelter Connie has learned: to build rapport with community members; to de-escalate conflicts; to engage with families (especially children); to set useful boundaries for social work.
