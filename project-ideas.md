This page lists project ideas that I haven't had time to follow through with. 
The template for this page is directly sourced from [Issa Rice](http://issarice.com/project-ideas).

> Effort can be rated on the following scale. In each case I assume I am the one performing the task. Days here refer to work days, so 8 hour periods.

|make a roster of interns and work-studies|get the list on the webpage. would be nice to have photos, job description, service dates. also a rubric for interns.|0|volunteer.fscss.org|markdown|
|improve website|can I write a python script to pull the schedule from Volgistics? Correct volunteer info, shelter family info, and on-call staff is super important. Additionally, the numbering on the families has been off, thus making the shelter count inconsistent (101 is people #1-4, and then 103's kids start at number 4 and 5.... so numbers need to be fixed).|2|shelter.fscss.org?|linode server with password protected [uiki](https://github.com/mattmight/uiki)|

## Tasks for Tara

Ensure daily shifts at Pear Blossom Place are covered by volunteers, and communicate in ample time to supervisor when gaps in coverage appear
- how does this weekend look? where are the gaps in coverage?
	- could you report to Natalie the gaps in coverage: open greeter shifts especially?

Supervise college work-study students at Pear Blossom Place.  Supervise the work of the volunteers and interns and provide ongoing support and training through group and individual meetings, check-in phone calls, e-mails, and personal appreciations for their efforts.

- Could you review the [roster of active work studies and interns](https://github.com/coltongrainger/work/blob/master/public/learning-plans/roster.md)
- could you skim the following?
  - St Martin Univerisity's [Social Work Internship Learning Goals](https://github.com/coltongrainger/work/blob/master/public/learning-plans/2018-BSW-Field-Education-Contract-SMU.md)
  - Evergreen's [Field Supervisor Guidelines](http://www.evergreen.edu/individualstudy/fieldsupervisorguidelines) (2018) and [Internship Guidelines](https://github.com/coltongrainger/work/raw/master/public/learning-plans/2012-cclba-internship-outline.pdf) (2012).

Research and identify applicable community groups, events, and meetings to attend with the purpose of recruiting volunteers, increasing agency visibility, and providing direct resource information to clients

- review [list of shelters in Thurston County](https://github.com/coltongrainger/work/raw/master/public/curriculum/2017-11-thurston-county-shelters.pdf)
- review [Family Support Center client flow](https://github.com/coltongrainger/work/raw/master/public/curriculum/fscss-client-flow.pdf)
- review [churches pamphletted](https://github.com/coltongrainger/work/blob/master/public/adverts/2017-religious-letter/churches.csv) (feel free to reach out via phone, or star churches you might want to visit).

Work to increase volunteer retention, providing ongoing training opportunities

- review [volunteer satisfaction survey](http://volunteer.fscss.org/surveys.html)
- review [list of volunteers who need thank you cards](https://github.com/coltongrainger/work/blob/master/public/volunteer-management/appreciation/2017-12-29-thank-you-cards.txt) (I am comfortable writing these, just wanted you to know who's been of great service to us).
